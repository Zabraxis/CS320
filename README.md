How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
There are a number of ways to go about this, one of them is to implement security protection by using proper methods
of authentication, such as 2 step authorization or strict password policies. Ensuring there are never any data leaks 
while tranferring data by using secure channels and data encryption. 
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I would do this by listening to the users feedcack, through story boards and other such methods. If you ask, you will 
receive an answer to all of the questions you ask, sometimes it can be helpful to listen to user feedback, everything
is not set in stone just because you have an idea in your head.
How do I approach designing software?
My apoproach to designing software is simple, find a structure suitable to the task at hand and run with it. If there are any errors, make every attempt to fix them before moving on any further, so they will not become a bigger problem.
A good design to start wuth is preferable to not having a starting place, putting together a cohesive model is of the utmost importantce and then ensuring that the integration is in line. Above almost everything else, it is  important to ensure safety and security for the user, while keeping everything fully functional and operational, and ensuring that any errors can easily be fixed.
